VirtualBox
	copy down Ubuntu, install
        follow steps
        Bridge Network allows VMs to use home WiFi router to talk out to Internet
        - needed to install packages
        - also responsible for assigning the 192.168.1.## 
        - these might get re-assigned - need to have static IP addresses
        - create a new HOST-only K8S network - disable DHCP so addresses stay static 
        - on my VBOX - network had an Adapter 2 vboxnet0 HOST-ONLY
		ssh rjzawis@192.168.1.7   #kubemaster  192.168.56.2 {sudo ifconfig epn0s8 192.168.56.2}
		ssh rjzawis@192.168.1.8   #kube-node1  192.168.56.3
		ssh rjzawis@192.168.1.9   #kube-node2  192.168.56.4
          - on each vbox - vi /etc/network/interfaces and add below lines to save IP static address
		# configure enp0s8 interface
		auto enp0s8
		iface enp0s8 inet static
		      address 192.168.56.2 / 3 / 4
		      netmask 255.255.255.0
	  - turn off swap
            - swapoff -a
            - vi /etc/fstab
              - comment out last line that deals with swap setting
          - save & reboot
          - ssh-copy-id username@ip.a.dd.r  - to set up password-less ssh entry
          - on restart 
            - ifconfig & verify static IP addresses exist {for k8s host-only network  AND}
            - can ping www.google.com {for internet connectivity to install packages} 




on VMs - steps, install, etc
========
 be root user
 cat /etc/hostname
 - change name
 cat /etc/hosts
 - add another line at top after localhost 127.0.1.1 hostname - where hostname matches above changed_nm
 shutdown now - reboot to have hostname and /etc/hosts files take effect

- K8S, DOCKER etc are all installed
- run docker / docker-compose / kubeadm / kubectl / kubelet version cmds to verify
- have 1 MASTER 2 NODES 
- MASTER cfg
  - before we can connect, have to determine which NETWORK we are using to communication
    - remember above - we cfg'd the HOST-ONLY network so we have static 192.xxx.xx.x IPs
  - have to tell MASTER to select & use this HOST-ONLY network for comms
  - this is referred to as POD NETWORK plug-in
  - NETWORK MUST BE DEPLOYED BEFORE ANY APPLICATIONS.
    - KUBE-DNS - internal helper service will NOT start up before this network is installed
    - KUBEADM ONLY SUPPORTS CONTAINER NETWORK INTERFACE {CNI} based networks, does NOT support kubenet
  
This was in the course notes - not sure if it's needed or not
Documentation web site seems to be having an issue.
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml

  


kube-apiserver on MASTER
kubelet on WORKERS - this is how they 'talk'

etcd on MASTER
controller, scheduler on MASTER

kubectl cmd used to deploy 'run' containers, get 'cluster-info', get 'nodes' info

==================================================================================================================
==================================================================================================================

MINIKUBE
========
downloadable 1 EXE to install all-n-1 minicluster into VirtualBox to play with
  MASTER
    kube-apiserver, etcd, node-controller, replica-controller, scheduler
  NODES
    kubelet, container_runtime
  - combines all these together in a single container
  - need the minikube.exe, HyperVisor to install mini-cluster into, & kubectl to interact with it


on iMac
brew uninstall minikube kubectl {or upgrade, update - may have to unlink some cmds}
brew install minikube kubectl


kubectl expose deployment ... to access web pages
kubectl service app url .... get url
kubectl delete deployment ... cleans up

KUBEADM

needed to "easily" define multiple machines, define MASTER, NODEs

- must have multiple machines to set up a cluster
- designate 1 as MASTER, others as WORKERs
- install container runtime on VMs {docker"
- install kubeadm on all VMs
- MASTER - initialize MASTER
  - installs all required components to identify this as MASTER and to allow communications with WORKERs
- before connecting WORKERS, VERIFY ALL network pre-requisites
  - need network connectivity in order for all this to work
- can't have just normal network connectivity
- k8s requires a "special network" called a POD Network to perform all inter-vm communications
- then we can join the WORKER nodes to the MASTER node and verify they're all communicating properly
- do all this before deploying applications/micro-services
